I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble logging in, that sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when it just keeps spinning. I'll do my best to help you get back into your account.

To properly diagnose this, could you please provide a few more details?

1.  **What happens exactly when it "keeps spinning"?** Does any error message appear at all, even for a moment?
2.  **Which browser are you using (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)?**
3.  **Have you tried logging in from a different browser or an incognito/private window?**
4.  **Have you tried clearing your browser's cache and cookies?** (This often resolves spinning issues.)
5.  **Are you trying to log in with a username/password, or are you using a third-party service like Google, Microsoft, or Apple login?**
6.  **Has logging in worked for you previously, or is this a new issue?**

Once I have a bit more information, I can provide you with more targeted troubleshooting steps!

2.  **How large is your team, or how many users will need access to the platform?**
