Hello there! I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble logging into your account and that it just "keeps spinning." That sounds really frustrating, and I understand how important it is to access your account. Let's work together to figure out what's going on!

To help me diagnose this, could you please provide a little more detail?

1.  **What browser are you using (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)?** Also, is it up to date?
2.  **Are you trying to log in from a computer or a mobile device?** If mobile, is it via a browser or a dedicated app?
3.  **Have you recently cleared your browser's cache and cookies?** Sometimes old data can interfere with the login process.
4.  **Are you seeing any specific error messages, even if brief, before it starts spinning?**
5.  **Have you tried restarting your computer/device or checking your internet connection?**

In the meantime, here are a few common troubleshooting steps that often resolve "spinning" login issues:

*   **Clear your browser's cache and cookies:** This is often the first step as it removes old, potentially corrupt data that might be causing the issue.
    *   *For Chrome:* Go to Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data. Select "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files," then click "Clear data."
    *   *For Firefox:* Go to Settings > Privacy & Security. Under "Cookies and Site Data," click "Clear Data." Make sure both options are checked and click "Clear."
    *   *For Safari:* Go to Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data, then remove data for our site. You might also need to clear history (Safari > History > Clear History...).
*   **Try logging in using an Incognito or Private browsing window:** This mode disables extensions and doesn't use existing cookies, which can help determine if an extension or old cookie is the problem.
*   **Try a different browser:** If you're using Chrome, try Firefox or Edge, or vice-versa. This can help us understand if the issue is browser-specific.
*   **Check your internet connection:** Ensure your internet connection is stable. Sometimes a weak or intermittent connection can cause loading issues. You might try resetting your router if you haven't recently.

Please try these steps and let me know if any of them help, along with answers to the questions above. I'm here to help you get back into your account!
